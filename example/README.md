# Example app with auto-discovery feature

This is an example app that demonstrates the auto-discovery feature of the router.

Using the auto-discovery feature, you can organize your routers in a directory structure and have them automatically registered by the router.

The `app.py` file contains the main application code, and the `routers` directory contains the router modules.
